## Why is the FAQ in french only?

The Cardano project is already well documented in english and you can find many docs - technical and blog posts - on internet.

We (operators of STKH) are French. We therefore have a greater interest and incentive to translate and produce short documentation in french.

That said, **our newsletter is and will always be written in both english and french.**
