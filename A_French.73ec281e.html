<h2 id="why-is-the-faq-in-french-only">Why is the FAQ in french only?</h2><p>The Cardano project is already well documented in english and you can find many docs - technical and blog posts - on internet.</p><p><strong>We</strong>, the operators of The Stakhanovite Stake Pool, <strong>are French. We therefore have a greater interest and incentive to produce short documentation in french</strong>.</p><p>That said, <strong>our newsletter is and will always be written in both FR and EN.</strong></p><p>We hope you won&#39;t mind too much!</p><p>Cheers,</p>
